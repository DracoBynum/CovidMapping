# Covid Mapping

For this project, I used data gathered by the New York Times to create two maps visualizing summary statistics from the Covid-19 pandemic: Case rate (cases/county population), and raw number of cases, mapped on the county level.

## Covid Cases Rates (cases/county population)

This maps primary function is to visualize the distribution of the highest and lowest case rates in counties across the United States.
